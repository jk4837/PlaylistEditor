# Playlist Editor

Manage and edit playlists in-game.

8 buttons will be created by this mod:
* Delete List - Delete selected playlist, button will be disabled if "Custom Level" is selected
* Create List - Create a new empty playlist with input name
* Delete - Overwrite the delete button created by core mod, remove selected song from data storage
* Remove - Remove selected song from selected playlist, or remove from all playlists instead if "Custom Levels" is selected
* Delete and Remove - Delete Song and Remove Song at once
* Insert - Insert the selected song into one of the playlists, if the original list picture is empty, the song picture will become the playlist picture
* Move Up - Moves the selected song order up in the playlist, button will be disabled if "Custom Level" is selected
* Move Down - Moves the selected song order down in the playlist, button will be disabled if "Custom Level" is selected

For all actions above, not only "custom levels" will be refreshed, but also all custom playlists will be refreshed, while selections will remain at the original level

_*Be Aware: Before the next BMBF sync, use "BMBF > Tools > Reload Playlist Folder" to make the playlist consistent with the BMBF, otherwise you may lose changes!*_
